Scenario:

Botium Toys’ IT manager asked you to conduct an internal audit of the company’s assets, controls, and adherence to compliance regulations and standards.
Then, based on the company’s current goals and level of risk, she requested that you complete a controls assessment and compliance checklist to identify and explain ways that the company can improve its security posture.

Your task is to clearly and concisely communicate your findings and recommendations to the IT manager and other stakeholders, so they can implement the necessary controls and create appropriate documentation, processes, and procedures to ensure business continuity, the safety of critical assets, and compliance.

SUBJECT: Internal IT Audit Findings and Recommendations

Dear Colleagues,

Please review the following information regarding the Botium Toys internal audit scope, goals, critical findings, summary and recommendations.

Scope:

•	The following items are considered in scope:

  o	Accounting
  
  o	Endpoint Detection
  
  o	Firewalls
  
  o	Intrusion Detection Systems
  
  o	Security Information and Event Management System
  
•	The systems will be evaluated for:

  o	Current user permissions
  
  o	Current implemented controls
  
  o	Current procedures and protocols
  
•	This audit will ensure that current user permissions, controls, procedures, and protocols in place align with the requirements of GDPR and PCI DSS.

•	This audit will ensure that current technology is accounted for, including both hardware and system access.

Goals:

•	Adhere to the NIST Cybersecurity Framework.

•	Establish a better process for systems to ensure compliance.

•	Fortify system controls.

•	Adopt the concept of least privilege when it comes to user credential management.

•	Establish the required policies and procedures, including playbooks.

•	Ensure that compliance requirements are being met by the organization.

Critical findings (must be addressed immediately):

•	Several controls need to be developed and implemented to meet audit goals, including:

  o	Least Privilege and Separation of Duties
  
  o	Disaster Recovery Plans
  
  o	Policies regarding passwords, access control, and account management
  
  o	Implementation of a password management system
  
  o	Encryption to ensure that website transactions are secure
  
  o	Intrusion Detection Systems
  
  o	Backup Plans
  
  o	AV software
  
  o	CCTV cameras
  
  o	Locks
  
  o	Manual monitoring, maintenance, and intervention for legacy systems
  
  o	Fire detection and prevention systems

Findings (should be addressed, but no immediate need):

•	The following controls should be implemented when possible:

  o	Time-controlled safe
  
  o	Adequate lighting
  
  o	Locking cabinets
  
  o	Signage indicating service provider for the alarm system

Summary/Recommendations:

It is recommended that Botium Toys promptly address the critical findings relating to compliance with GDPR and PCI DSS since the organization accepts online payments from customers worldwide, including the EU.
In addition to this, SOC1 and SOC2 guidance related to user access policies and overall data safety should be used to develop policies and procedures since one of the organization’s goals is to align themselves with the concept of least privilege.
It is also critical that the organization develop disaster recovery and backup plans to support business continuity in the event of a disaster.
In addition to this, implementing an intrusion detection system and AV software will support the organization’s ability to identify and mitigate potential risks, especially those related to the legacy systems that must be monitored manually.
In order to further secure assets located at Botium Toys’ physical location, locks and CCTV cameras should be used to secure physical assets and assist with investigations.
While not immediately necessary, the organization would also benefit from having a time-controlled safe, adequate lighting, locking cabinets, fire detection and prevention systems, and signage indicating the service provider for the alarm system.
