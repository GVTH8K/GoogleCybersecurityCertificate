Security Incident Report

| **Section 1: Identify the network protocol involved in the incident**                                                                                                                                                                                                   |

| The network protocol that was involved in the incident is the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP). This conclusion was drawn from the traffic log file that was generated through the use of tcpdump to capture DNS and HTTP activity associated with the yummyrecipesforme.com website. The malicious file was observed being transported to the users’ computers using the HTTP protocol at the application layer.                                                                                                                                                                      |
                                                                                                                                                                                                                          

| **Section 2: Document the incident**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |

| Several users contacted the website owner to report that they were being prompted to download and run a file to update their browser when visiting the website. Users also reported that their computers have been running slowly ever since. When attempting to log in to the web server, the owner realized that their account was locked out.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| The cybersecurity analyst for the site used a sandbox environment to test the functionality of the website without jeopardizing the company network. The analyst then ran tcpdump to capture the network and protocol traffic that was generated when interacting with the website. The analyst was then prompted to download a file claiming that it would update their browser. Following this, the analyst downloaded and ran the file and was redirected to a fake website called greatrecipesforme.com. The naming convention of this website was likely chosen to closely mimic the original site yummyrecipesforme.com.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| The analyst inspected the traffic log generated from tcpdump and found that the browser initially requested the IP address for yummyrecipesforme.com. Once the connection was established and the analyst had downloaded the file, it was found that there was a sudden change in network traffic as the browser requested a new IP resolution for greatrecipesforme.com. The network traffic was then rerouted to the new IP address for greatrecipesforme.com.                                                                                                                   |
| The senior cybersecurity professional analyzed the source code for the websites and the malicious file and discovered that an attacker had manipulated the website to append code that would prompt users to download a malicious file disguised as a browser update. Since the owner was also locked out of their account, it is suspected that the attacker used a brute-force attack to access the account and change the admin password. It was also found that the execution of the malicious file led to the users’ computers becoming compromised.                              |


| **Section 3: Recommend one remediation for brute force attacks**                                                                                                                                                                                                        |

| One remediation step that can be taken by the company is to implement two-factor authentication to protect against brute-force attacks. This implementation will require users to authenticate using their password, in addition to a security key and the associated PIN. Once the user has authenticated using both mechanisms, they will be granted access to the internal system. Any attempts to brute-force accounts in the future will now fail since the system requires additional mechanisms to authenticate.                                                              |
