Security Risk Assessment Report

| **Part 1: Select up to three hardening tools and methods to implement**                                                                                                                                       |

| One hardening tool that the organization can implement to address the identified vulnerabilities is multi-factor authentication. This will ensure that users are required to use multiple means of proving their identity before they are allowed to access internal systems. The second hardening tool that the organization can implement to address the identified vulnerabilities is the creation and enforcement of strong password policies. This will ensure that the policies enforce common best practices such as password length, acceptable characters, complexity requirements, and the rule to never share passwords. The third hardening tool that the organization can implement to address the identified vulnerabilities is the performance of regularly scheduled maintenance on the firewall. This entails checking and updating security configurations to ensure that there are no apparent gaps in protection and to stay ahead of potential threats.                                                                                                                                                                             |

| The enforcement of MFA within the organization will reduce the likelihood that an attacker will be successful in gaining access to the network via a brute-force or similar attack on user accounts. MFA will also make it more difficult for users to share passwords since the second factor will always be required. The enforcement of MFA is especially important for users that possess administrator-level privileges on the network.                                                                                  |                                                                                                
| The creation and enforcement of password policies within the organization will ensure that attackers have an increasingly difficult time accessing the network. This is due to the fact that users will no longer be able to choose weak or common passwords that make it easy for an attacker to compromise their account. This policy should be enforced regularly across the organization to ensure that all user accounts are adequately protected.                                                                      |
| Firewall maintenance should be a regular practice to ensure that they are fully updated and that the appropriate rules are in place. These rules should also be updated whenever there is a security event that takes place within the organization. This is especially important for events related to suspicious network traffic that was allowed into the network. Regular firewall maintenance can be used to protect against various types of attacks, including distributed denial-of-service, or DDoS, attacks.  |
